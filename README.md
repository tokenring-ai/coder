# Coder App

## Overview

The Coder app is an interactive developer assistant tool designed to help you work with your codebase in a conversational manner. It provides a chat interface where you can ask questions, issue commands, and interact with your source code, leveraging AI to assist with code edits, refactors, testing, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive chat interface**: Talk to the assistant in a conversational REPL.
- **Persistent chat history**: Sessions and message threads are saved in a SQLite database.
- **Command system**: Issue commands prefixed with `/` to manage contexts, plugins, queues, checkpoints, commits, rollbacks, and more.
- **Codebase integration**: Works directly with your source directory; can initialize with a TokenRing config.
- **Plugin support**: Extend functionality with plugins.
- **Multi-line input mode**: Supports multi-line text entry for complex queries or commands.
- **Queue management**: Batch multiple chat prompts to execute sequentially.
- **Test execution**: Run tests defined in your coder-config.js.
- **Git integration**: Commit changes or rollback git history from chat commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun
- Git initialized source directory

### Installation (local)

1. **Sync git submodules**: This project uses git submodules that need to be initialized and updated before installation:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: This project uses Bun as the package manager in a monorepo structure:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the application**: Use Bun to start the application:
  ```bash
  bun src/tr-coder.js --source ./path-to-your-codebase
  ```
### Installation (As local docker container)

1. **Sync git submodules**: This project uses git submodules that need to be initialized and updated before installation:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Build the docker container**: 
   ```bash
   # This command must be run in the root directory of the repo
   docker build -t token-ring/coder:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
   ```
   
3. **Run the docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -ti --net host $(env | grep '_KEY' | sed 's/^/-e /') -v ./:/repo:rw token-ring/coder:latest
   ```

#### Container Registry


TODO: This is not implemented yet
The Docker image is automatically built and published to GitHub Container Registry on each push to the main branch. You can pull the latest image with:



```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/[owner]/tokenring-coder:latest
```

Replace `[owner]` with the GitHub repository owner.

### Initialization

To initialize your source directory with the necessary TokenRing configuration file, pass the --initialize flag after your source directory. 
This will initialize a new .tokenring directory in your project, which stores a coder-config.js config file for your project that you can customize, as well as a sqlite database which stores your chat history.

```
tr-coder --source ./path-to-your-codebase --initialize
```

This copies a default `.tokenring/coder-config.js` into your source directory.

### Chat and Commands

Once started, you enter the chat REPL:

- Type natural language queries about your code.
- Use commands with `/` prefix, e.g., `/help`, `/commit`, `/checkpoint create`, `/reset`.
- For multi-line input, type `:paste`, enter your text, then `:end` to submit.
- Control commands: `/quit` to exit, `/history` to browse chat history.

### Commands

Some example commands:

- `/help`: Show available commands.
- `/checkpoint create [label]`: Save current chat state.
- `/commit`: Commit changes to git with AI-generated message.
- `/rollback [position]`: Rollback git history.
- `/contexts`: Manage chat contexts.
- `/plugins`: Enable or disable plugins.
- `/queue`: Manage a queue of chat prompts.
- `/test [all|<name>]`: Run tests defined in your config.
- `/history`: Browse previous chat sessions and messages.

## Architecture

- **CLI**: Entry point with argument parsing and session management (`tr-coder.js`).
- **Engine**: Core logic for commands, chat streaming, and persistent chat management.
- **Components**: React-based components for browsing chat history.
- **Utility**: Helper functions for logging, file management, and database initialization.

## Data Persistence

Chat data and sessions are stored in a SQLite database (`coder-database.sqlite`) managed through the Bun SQLite package.

## Extensibility

The system supports plugins which can add tools callable by the AI assistant during chat sessions.
